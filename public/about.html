<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>An enthusiast for learning and growing. Here with you all to demonstrate my snippets of learning. I know am yet in the growing stage and a 
  a lot of scope is there for improvement, which I would def in the time ahead :) but in the meanwhile would like you all to enjoy this
</p>

<p>So this portfolio is a very basic one comprising of concepts of HTML tags and how they are rendered. Here projects of Birthday invitation
  and a movie ranking has been displayed.

<p>Let's have a look of it. And before leaving please be bothered to spill some reviews for me(whatever it may be)</p>
